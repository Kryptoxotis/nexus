# Nexus POS System Development Plan (Single Location)

## Project Overview
Creating a single-location POS system called Nexus that handles:
- Payment processing interface
- Database management (add/delete records)
- Inventory management
- Membership database
- Calendar/events management
- PIN-protected actions (PIN: 12345)
- Clean, user-friendly, eye-catching interface

## System Architecture

- **Database**: SQLite (simple local database)
- **Frontend**: React with modern UI components
- **Authentication**: PIN-based (12345) for database actions
- **Styling**: Modern, clean, eye-catching design
